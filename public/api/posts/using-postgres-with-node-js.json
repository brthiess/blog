    "content": "When creating a node project, a database will often need to be used in order to store data such as user information.  This post will guide us through a simple set up to get started with node using postgres.\r\n\r\nFor those who don't know [Postgres](https:\/\/en.wikipedia.org\/wiki\/PostgreSQL) is a free and open source RDBMS.  I have been working with it for a bit now, and have found it similar to SQL Server in a lot of ways.  I find the syntax of Postgres to be quite natural.  \r\n\r\n## Starting off\r\n\r\n[Download and install Postgres](https:\/\/www.postgresql.org\/download\/) Postgres.  It should work for all operating systems.\r\n\r\n## Initialize the Database\r\n\r\nWe can use the `psql` command with `-d` to select the database and `-U` to select the user.\r\n\r\n`psql -d postgres -U postgres`\r\n\r\n## Create a role\r\n\r\nOnce logged in, create a role called `me` with a password of your choosing.\r\n\r\n`CREATE ROLE base_user WITH LOGIN PASSWORD 'your password';`\r\n\r\nTo view all of the roles in the database, run `\\du`.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow you can exit by typing `exit;`. \r\n\r\n\r\n## Create a database\r\n\r\nLog back into the database with the base_user. \r\n\r\n`psql -d postgres -U base_user`\r\n\r\nNow that we are in, it is time to create a database.\r\n\r\n`CREATE DATABASE your_database`\r\n\r\nYou can use the `\\list` command to see all of the databases\r\n\r\nUse `\\c your_database` to connect to the database.\r\n\r\n\r\n## Create a table\r\n\r\nOnce connected to the DB, we can create a table to hold some blog posts:\r\n\r\n\r\n```\r\nCREATE TABLE posts (\r\n    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,\r\n    title VARCHAR(100),\r\n    text text,\r\n    image VARCHAR(100),\r\n    date_posted timestamp\r\n);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow that we have created a blog posts table, let us insert a post:\r\n\r\n```\r\nINSERT INTO posts (title, text, image, date_posted)\r\nVALUES('First Post', 'My first post', '\/image.png', CURRENT_TIMESTAMP);\r\n```\r\n\r\nNow to see it in the database:\r\n\r\n`SELECT * FROM posts;`\r\n\r\n",
